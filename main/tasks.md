- DONE: have click add energy and set spiking to true
- DONE: make egdes only be rendered for the last-hovered node
- DONE: make edge weight editable, click and edit number text in the canvas
- DONE: make edges have an arrowhead
- DONE: fix the text of the edge weight so it doesn't overlap the line
- DONE: show self-edge as curve
- DONE: edge color as strength
- DONE: make a ring attractor and test it
- animate gradient for pulse, have pulse change the radius
- show the outgoing edges when a spike happens
- create a way to select something despite overlap. In particular, bi-directional edges
- make two ring attractors and join them like the paper
