- What do you think the weights are for that compass ring attractor system?
- Is my playground too crude to successfully model a ring attractor?
    - Timestep, completely discrete
    - Ring weights are not gaussian, just linear to zero and linear to negative
    - There is refactory period and decay
- Are their universal weigths for a simple ring attractor?
- Is there an easy way to extract the weights of your model?
    - What is d7?
    - (I probably need to read the paper more): at a practical level is contra and ipsi being as clockwise and counter-clockwise connections?


Notes:
- I'm not using gaussian, just linear tradeoff
