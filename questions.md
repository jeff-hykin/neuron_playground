- What do you think about my ring attractor in the playground? (Is it supposed to get stuck)
    - Timestep, completely discrete
    - Ring weights are not gaussian, just linear to zero and linear to negative
    - There is refactory period and decay

- Does modeling inhibition as negative energy make sense?
    
- What do you think are the weights for the compass ring attractor system?

- Are their universal weights for a simple ring attractor?

- Is there an easy way to extract the weights of your model?
    - What is d7?
    - (I probably need to read the paper more): at a practical level is contra and ipsi being as clockwise and counter-clockwise connections?


Notes:
- I'm not using gaussian, just linear tradeoff
