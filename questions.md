- Does modeling inhibition as negative energy make sense?
- Is there an easy way to extract the weights from one of the Seismic models?
    - What is d7?
    - (I probably need to read the paper more): at a practical what does "contra" and "ipsi" imply?
- Do you think this descrete simulation is too simplified? (Do I need a bursting model)
- Interesting, possibly bad behavior for the simple ring attractor:
    - Can't "center" the bump with a consistently firing node, unless we get noise (and then it centers very slowly)
    - switching sides (on the huge ring) is impossible with a single neuron firing repeatedly, it needs friends. Do you think this is biologically plausible?
    - When starting the first node, it take multiple tries to get it to start.
    - There are some ways to "kill" the ring
    - Should I add a random chance that a node can fire for no reason?
