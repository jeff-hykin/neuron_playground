## What is this?

This is a little simulator for connecting neurons in a network, feeding them inputs and observing how their spiking patterns flow throughout the network.


## How do I use it? 

You can open up the website [here](https://jeff-hykin.github.io/neuron_playground/).

- Right click to add a neuron
- Click and drag to move a neuron around or pan around the canvas
- Scroll to zoom in and out
- Shift-click one neuron, then shift-click another neuron to create an connection between them.
- Click a connection to change its weight (it can be negative, expected values are between -1 and 1)
- Click a neuron to make it spike/fire
- Click the "Next" button to step the simulation forward one step and see the results
- You can make pretty advanced networks by saving, editing the JSON of the save file, and loading it back in
